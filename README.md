A small platformer made using C# in Godot.

I followed UmaiPixel's helpful [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyckz_-Rzq6ClGevL2fneJ5YJnMPKWa4M) on making a platformer in Godot to get started.


## Key Takeaways

- Using C# in Godot 3.0+
- 2D Game in Godot
- Understanding the difference between KinematicBody2d and Area2D (and RigidBody2D and StaticBody2D)
- AnimatedSprites
